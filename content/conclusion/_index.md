This is the end, thanks for reading! There are three things I would suggest as key takeaways:

- The blockchain space is worth watching if you're interested in social production or digitally native means of production.
- Commons based peer production and common pool resources are useful lenses through which to observe the space - the paradigm is that blockchains are a revolution in how we use the digital commons and are shaking up the incentives for participating in commons-based peer production.
- Look at how decisions are being made within these projects. If governance is decentralized and permissionless you should be able to find where it is happening and participate in that process.

If you read this all the way through I would appreciate any feedback you have to offer.

Cheers,

Richard Red
