[Genesis Alpha](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x294f999356ed03347c7a23bcbcf8d33fa41dc830/proposals/0x28c5b9efd5bdec2c69c613d2df4b5e1b92e44a2d3c2f5092fb45187570029009) is a DAO created by the DAOstack team on the Ethereum mainnet. It serves as a testing ground, a showcase of DAOstack's functionality, and a way to govern the use of some of the project's resources. At time of writing (June 2019) it controls around $21,000 worth of ETH, GEN and DAI. There are 183 reputation holders, the most influential of which holds 2.4%, so voting power is reasonably well distributed among the participants. To become a member, people create proposals requesting Rep, usually introducing themselves and being approved.
