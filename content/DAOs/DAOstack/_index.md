DAOstack pitches itself more directly as a platform and toolset for creating DAOs, "An operating system for collective intelligence". 

> DAOSTACK POWERS DECENTRALIZED COMPANIES, FUNDS AND MARKETS TO MAKE FAST AND INNOVATIVE DECISIONS AT SCALE.

Allowing these DAOs to operate at scale is central to DAOstack's approach, the key point of which is the use of prediction markets to facilitate decision-making that represents the majority's perspective without requiring the majority to participate. They refer to this as [Holographic Consensus](https://medium.com/daostack/holographic-consensus-part-2-4fd461e8dcde). 

Within a DAO, members are assigned voting tokens and the DAO can perform certain operations (like sending resources from a pool it controls) when proposals are approved by a majority of the voting tokens. Some DAOs also allow GEN tokens to be exchanged for reputation (voting power), e.g. [dxDAO](https://dxdao.daostack.io/stake-for-your-vote). Ordinarily proposals require a majority of all the voting power for approval and have a long voting period. GEN tokens ([issued by DAOstack in an ICO](https://medium.com/daostack/daostack-token-sale-successfully-concluded-ec813e7adc6b)) can be "staked" to predict the outcome and "boost" the proposal such that its voting period is shortened and only a relative majority is required for the proposal to be approved and implemented. 

The rationale for this system is that DAOs cannot scale to many decisions involving many people if all of the people must participate in all of the decisions. GEN holders who predict/stake could in principle allow the DAOs to make decisions that reflect the majority opinion without having to involve a majority of participants. DAOs effectively pay for this service by offering rewards to GEN stakers. GEN stakers operate by learning what a DAO values and how it operates so that they can accurately predict the outcomes of proposals.

This is an interesting concept which addresses a legitimate issue for DAOs that wish to make decisions at a high degree of granularity. Information overload and the scarcity of stakeholder attention are significant issues for any DAO (or other form of direct democracy) that reaches a large scale. Low voter participation means that outcomes are more easily swayed by direct beneficiaries or others who have a vested interest. High voter turnout from a large scale decentralized entity with many members is difficult to achieve and maintain. Participation must also be thoughtful or is likely to result in poor decisions.

DAOstack is another example of a project which is oriented towards addressing issues of scale that are likely to arise in the long term. The first challenge for these projects is to reach a scale of participation where their solutions can be demonstrated and tested.

Unlike Aragon, DAOstack DAOs are created manually by the project team. People who wish to form one first initiate contact with the project team. This allows for greater flexibility in how these DAOs are configured, but the gatekeeping results in a smaller total number of DAOs using DAOstack's [Alchemy](https://alchemy.daostack.io/) (11 in June 2019). DAOstack plans to allow for direct creation of DAOs by users in future.
