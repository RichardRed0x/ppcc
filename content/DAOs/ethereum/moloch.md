Moloch DAO is a smart contract DAO launched in early 2019 for funding development of the Ethereum ecosystem. Members in the DAO have non-transferable shares which they can use to vote on proposals. The DAO is funded by "tribute", when new members join they add resources to the fund. It is in a sense a DAO for collectively administering donations.

Proposals relate to minting new shares and assigning them to (new or existing) members in exchange for tribute (or promised work). Members vote to control who is allowed to join and how shares are issued. All members can cash in their shares for a proportion of the fund, but they then lose voting power. When a proposal passes, any members of the defeated minority who opposed it can withdraw their funds ("ragequit") before the proposal is paid out, leaving those who approved it to pay a larger proportion. This mechanism is intended to make the fund resistant to majority attack - if a majority approves a large payment for itself the minority can exit before they are diluted by this act. It may also serve to promote group cohesion, as members may avoid pushing or voting for a proposal if they believe it will cause other members to ragequit.

As of August 18th 2019, 85 [Moloch DAO proposals](https://molochdao.com/proposals) have been completed, and a further 10 are being voted on. Most of the proposals so far have been about granting membership (and some shares) to specific Ethereum community members. The standard issue of new shares is 100, for which people have been contributing an equivalent quantity of 100 ETH (~$20,000). [Vitalik Buterin](https://molochdao.com/proposals/50) and [Joseph Lubin](https://molochdao.com/proposals/46) both acquired 1,000 shares (and donated 1,000 ETH) each. Many proposals refer to applicants as numbered members of an organization (e.g. ConsenSys has 9 members, Ethereum Foundation has 10). In this initial phase the DAO is being seeded with members who are effectively hand-picked by the leaders in the ecosystem.

More recently, Moloch seems to be moving past the onboarding phase and there are a greater proportion of proposals to fund specific people/projects. The fund currently holds 7249 ETH (~$1.5 million) and has paid out ~$55k so far, most funded proposals are for <$10k.
